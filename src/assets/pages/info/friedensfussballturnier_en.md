With the turnament we want to remind the deceased player of 1. FC Kaiserslautern who is world champion of 1954 and died in 1995. Moreover he was a deserteur of the armed forces, a convinced opponent of war and an anti-fascist who only survived his death sentence through the capitulation of Nazi Germany. During the postwar years (Nachkriegsjahre) Werner Liebrich committed against remilitarisation and nuclear armament during the 80ies.

Werner Liebrich descended from a working-class familiy. His Vater Ernst Karl was as a communist persecuted by the nazis and also a member of the resistrance group of (Widerstandsgruppe) Oskar Brill. After the detention of his father, his two sons lived at their mother in abject poverty. They were dependent on the help of relatives and friends. Worse was, that they were treated like outlaws. The Liebrichs were the only family of FC Kaiserslautern who, with their father Liebrich, were political resistants against the Nazi dictatorship and with that evidently at least one member of the FC Kaiserslautern.

With the turnament we also want to take a stand against increasing racism and the social lurch to the right. This being the case we are very happy that we are able to staff this year's tournament internationally again.

The turnament will be hold at the compound of SV Ottenberg where Werner Liebrich after his career was an active trainer for several years.
