The costs for the camp are favourable that we presumably will work cost-neutral, but also will not generate minus costs. We will get planning certainty through your donation. All earnings will be invested to 100 % into the "Stopp Air Base Ramstein" campaign. Each donation - will it be it ever so small - is welcome and helps!!!

Unfortunately it is not possible to organize a camp as such for free. Having said this, we are interested that every activist is able to participate in this event. The ticket quotation was discussed very long and detailed. Our sustainable concept is that people with a better financial condition, contribute more through their support of donations or by purchasing a soli-ticket that people in a precarious financial situation can afford their entrance so that everybody is involved into the funding of the camp. Strong shoulders are allowed to support more solidary. We are not able and willing to canvass the individual financial situations, we ask you for a honest and conscious choice of your ticket.

## Catering

We ask to refrain from self-supply. On the one hand we want to strengthen the shared itdentity through the common kitchen, on the other hand the risk is barely responsible for both, the organisation of this camp and the "Stopp Air Base Ramstein" campaign, if everybody between their tents operate with liquefied petroleum gas for their grills. Lasat but not least, the environmental fact: the rubbish would definately become rampant.
